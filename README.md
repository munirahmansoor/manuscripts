# what the eye can and can't see

Nation-building, the obsession with narrative making 
Who holds the pen to frame history 
The power dynamics 
How every empire builds their truth and reality through the exploitation of their people
The look at how the sea became a space for people to exercise autonomy 
Land and sea divided by virtue of borders 
What is the future of the region? 
Breaking apart how lines and borders are created, how alot of myths and narratives exists as a way to determine one’s rights to their land 

Culture in late capitalism is tied to broad global forces, though, as Arjun Appadurai argues, the traffic is not all one way, with the central tension in the contemporary world being that between ‘cultural homogenization and cultural heterogenization.’

## Vegetal ornaments
Prayer mat, clothing motifs and design, textiles, architecture, crockery, kitchen tools, Quran, books, mastheads 

The use of vegetal (botanical) ornaments and calligraphy is another central principle of Islamic art. Arabic script, especially the Qur'anic verses, is revered and used extensively in Islamic art, embellishing architecture, ceramics, textiles, and manuscripts. It is more than just  a method of written communication; it is a form of aesthetic expression and a means of visualizing the divine word. The versatility of Arabic script lends itself to an enormous range of artistic creativity, from angular Kufic to flowing Naskh, each style imbued with its own unique beauty and spiritual resonance (source)

A  key  difference  between  Mythological Patterns  &  Design  and Islamic  Patterns  & Design  lies  in their approach  to  symbolism.  Mythological  patterns  are  often more explicit,  utilizing  recognizable  figures  and elements from various myths. They employ a symbolic language that refers to the physical and the tangible one,  acting  as metaphoric representations  of divine  beings or mythological  narratives. Conversely,  Islamic patterns, in adhering to Islamic prohibitions against the depiction of living beings (animals, birds, humanistic figures, etc.), especially divine entities, lean towards the abstract. The patterns in Islamic art are not meant to represent something concrete; instead, they invite contemplation of the infinite, the spiritual, and the divine. This  abstraction  imbues  Islamic  designs  with  a  universal  quality,  transcending  cultural  and  geographical boundaries.  (-with recommendations on prayer mat designs source)

Craft vs design (source)


Design history beyond the canon

Craft vs design
Craft is the material translation of design. Craft is part of design
Design is done by human beings to, for, and with other human beings. Design is also done among objects and the world we live in. Perhaps craft is best thought of as a verb that represents the material trans-lation of the work of design. As such, we may question the call for design to transform itself into some sort of supra-discipline intended to coordinate, corral, and control the work and craft of others, not only in the politically charged fields of science, technology, engineer-ing, and math, but also through an incursion into politics (as in design for sustainability) and management (as in design thinking)
